""" Explanation:
We generated links for the static files using the url_for() method and added it to template files, enclosing them in {{}}
We provided the link for style.css by using: {{url_for('static', filename="style.acss")}}
"""

""" Questions:
What are static files or assets?
Static files are CSS, JS, images or siomilar files which ar sent to the client without server intervention

What is the url_for() function used for?
It is used to generate absolute URLs for endpoints.  We can use it to build URLs for view functions as well
